# PII Anonymizer with SpaCy and Regular Expressions

**Overview**

This Python project provides a tool to anonymize various types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within text documents. It combines regular expressions for pattern-matching specific PII formats and spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities for broader identification of names, locations, and organizations.

**Features**

*   Anonymizes various standard PII types:
    *   Phone numbers
    *   Email addresses
    *   Social Security Numbers (Example: US-specific)
    *   Websites
*   Extensible support for additional PII patterns through configuration
*   Handles custom proper nouns, including potential physical addresses
*   Generates a lookup table to enable reverse anonymization if needed

**Usage**

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    (Ensure you have `requirements.txt` listing `spacy` and any other needed libraries)

2.  **Download spaCy Model:**

    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

3.  **Run the Example:**

    ```python
    python reduxer.py  # Assuming your script is named 'anonymizer.py'
    ```

**Configuration**

The `pii_config` dictionary in the code defines PII patterns and placeholders. Customize it to add or modify PII types:

```python
pii_config = {
    'new_pii_type': (r'regex_pattern', '[PLACEHOLDER]'),
    # ... 
}
```

**Considerations**

*   **Accuracy:** NER models may have limitations. Regularly evaluate the anonymizer's output.
*   **Security:** Store lookup tables securely if they contain sensitive data.
*   **Context:** The effectiveness of anonymization depends on the specific use case and the sensitivity of the text.

**Potential Enhancements**

*   **More PII Types:** Add support for diverse PII formats (e.g., credit cards, dates, etc.)
*   **Multilingual Support:** Adapt for non-English languages with compatible spaCy models.
*   **Obfuscation Techniques:** Consider alternatives to placeholders, such as hashing or noise addition.

**Contributing**

We welcome contributions to improve this PII anonymizer. Please submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
